# Stock Price Prediction - Time Series Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

A Python project that predicts stock prices using a time series forecasting model. The project uses historical stock price data to train and evaluate the model.

---

## Features

- **Dataset**: Uses historical stock price data downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and creates features/target variables.
- **Model**: Trains a Linear Regression model to predict the next day's closing price.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates the model using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted prices.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
- **Visualization**: Includes a plot comparing actual vs predicted stock prices.
