# Handwritten Digit Recognition - Image Classification üñãÔ∏è

A Python project that classifies handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) using a Neural Network. The project uses the **MNIST Dataset** to train and evaluate the model.

---

## Features

- **Dataset**: Uses the MNIST Dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
- **Preprocessing**: Scales and reshapes the image data for input into the Neural Network.
- **Model**: Trains a simple Neural Network to classify digits.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates the model using:
  - **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the model.
  - **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Visualization**: Includes a plot of a sample image and the confusion matrix.
