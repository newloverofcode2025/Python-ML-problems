# Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Tree ðŸ’¼

A Python project that predicts loan approval using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The project uses a synthetic dataset to train and evaluate the model.

---

## Features

- **Dataset**: Uses a synthetic dataset with features like income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status.
- **Model**: Trains a Decision Tree Classifier to predict loan approval.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates the model using:
  - **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Includes a visualization of the decision tree.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanApprovalPrediction.git
cd LoanApprovalPrediction
The script will:
Create a synthetic dataset for loan approval prediction.
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the testing data and display:
Accuracy score.
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
Confusion matrix (visualized using a heatmap).
Visualize the decision tree.
