# Iris Dataset Classification ðŸŒ¸

A Python script that classifies iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning.

## Features
- Loads and explores the Iris Dataset.
- Preprocesses the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and scaling the features.
- Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
- Evaluates the model on the testing data and displays:
  - Accuracy score.
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
  - Confusion matrix (visualized using a heatmap).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IrisClassification.git
   cd IrisClassification
   Explanation
The program works as follows:

Loads the Iris Dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Splits the data into training and testing sets and scales the features.
Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Evaluates the model on the testing data and displays performance metrics.
